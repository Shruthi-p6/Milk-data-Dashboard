# Milk Data Transformation and Visualization Project- A team project

## Project Highlights

### Data Transformation
We used Python, specifically leveraging NumPy and pandas, to convert unstructured raw milk data into a standardized Excel format. This transformation was essential for ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

### Data Visualization
We utilized MongoDB Charts to create insightful visualizations. These visualizations provided a clear understanding of the data and helped us identify significant patterns and trends.

### Enhanced Cloud Capabilities
By integrating our visualizations with cloud capabilities, we improved the accessibility and scalability of our data analysis.

This project significantly improved our data processing and analytical skills and reinforced the importance of teamwork and collaboration. The visualizations provided clear, actionable insights that can help farm businesses make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving their operational efficiency.
